# 🌱 Beginner Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects I built while learning the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature of web development, and together they reflect my hands-on practice as a beginner.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. 🖱️ Custom Cursor
A creative project where the default mouse pointer is replaced with a **custom-designed cursor**.  
The cursor style changes dynamically as you move across the page, giving the site a modern and interactive feel.  
This project helped me explore **CSS styling, mouse events, and user interface customization**.

### 2. ❓ Question Button
A playful project with a button that can never be clicked.  
Whenever the user tries to click it, the button **immediately changes its position and jumps to another spot on the screen**.  
This way, it always runs away and can never be pressed — a fun practice in **event handling, positioning, and dynamic CSS changes**.

### 3. ⛅ Simple Weather App
A weather checking app where the user can enter a Location and get current weather details.  
It uses an external **API call** to fetch live weather data and displays temperature and conditions on the screen.  
This project gave me an introduction to **APIs, JSON responses, and asynchronous JavaScript (fetch)**.

### 4. 🖼️ Image Slider
An image slideshow that lets you view multiple images one after another.  
It uses JavaScript to **switch images dynamically**, and CSS for styling and transitions.  
This project was helpful to understand **DOM manipulation and working with multiple images**.

### 6. 😀 Random Emoji Generator
A fun project that shows a random emoji.  
- On **mobile/phone**, a new emoji is generated when you **tap/click the generate button**.  
- On **laptop/desktop**, a new emoji is generated when you **hover over the emoji**.  
This way, the same project behaves differently depending on the device, which helped me practice **event handling for different user interactions**.

### 7. 🖼️ Multiple Image Hovering
A project that displays multiple images, and when you hover over one, it highlights or changes appearance while dimming the others.  
This creates a **gallery-like effect**, making it easier to focus on the image being hovered.  
It was useful for learning **hover effects, CSS transitions, and image manipulation with JavaScript**.
