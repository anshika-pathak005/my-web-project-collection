# Beginner Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects I built while learning the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature of web development, and together they reflect my hands-on practice as a beginner.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. Quote Generator
A small app that displays random quotes.  
It fetches quotes from a local dataset and shows them dynamically when the user clicks a button.  
This project helped me practice working with **JSON data, DOM manipulation, and event handling**.

### 2. Random Emoji Generator
A fun project that shows a random emoji.  
- On **mobile/phone**, a new emoji is generated when you **tap/click the button**.  
- On **laptop/desktop**, a new emoji is generated when you **hover over the button**.  
This way, the same project behaves differently depending on the device, which helped me practice **event handling for different user interactions**.

### 3. Simple Weather App
A weather checking app where the user can enter a city name and get current weather details.  
It uses an external **API call** to fetch live weather data and displays temperature and conditions on the screen.  
This project gave me an introduction to **APIs, JSON responses, and asynchronous JavaScript (fetch)**.

Itâ€™s a simple way to practice **DOM updates, CSS manipulation, and JavaScript functions**.

### 5. Stopwatch
A digital stopwatch with **start, pause, and reset** functionality.  
It uses JavaScriptâ€™s **setInterval and clearInterval** methods to track time and update the display.  
This project helped me practice **timers and event handling**.

### 7. Image Slider
An image slideshow that lets you view multiple images one after another.  
It uses JavaScript to **switch images dynamically**, and CSS for styling and transitions.  
This project was helpful to understand **DOM manipulation and working with multiple images**.

### 8. Password Generator
A simple app that generates random secure passwords.  
It includes options like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
The user can also set the **strength level (Easy, Medium, Hard)** to control how strong and complex the generated password will be.  
This project improved my understanding of **string manipulation and randomness in JavaScript**.

### 9. QR Code Generator
An app that takes text or a link as input and instantly generates a QR code.  
It uses a **QR code library** to render the code, making it scannable with any mobile device.  
This was a good project to learn about **third-party libraries and dynamic DOM updates**.

### 10. Question Button
A playful project with a button that can never be clicked.  
Whenever the user tries to click it, the button **immediately changes its position and jumps to another spot on the screen**.  
This way, it always runs away and can never be pressed â€” a fun practice in **event handling, positioning, and dynamic CSS changes**.
